# cursive-open-editor

Lets you open an external editor in a [Cursive](https://github.com/gyscos/cursive) application.

This lets you implement things like `git rebase -i`, or other times you want the user to do a lot of text editing in an environment they are comfortable with.

There are lots of customization options; you can select the way the editor is picked,
whether to generate a temporary file or to use an existing file,
and custom invocations for the editor program.

See the examples directory for examples.
